This code was written within an hour, it is not perfect, nor is it well commented. To modify the number of windings, edit line 5:

#define TOTAL_WINDINGS 1885 //total number of loops of copper wire

You will need to experiment with this value until it results in a coil with the correct resistance.
If you are a programmer, please feel free to rewrite this code... and even share it so others can use it!
